# Research Task: Quantum Computing's Impact on CyberSecurity

Conduct comprehensive research on how quantum computing advancements are affecting cybersecurity, focusing on:

- Specific threats to current encryption methods
- Proposed quantum-resistant cryptography solutions
- Timeline predictions for "quantum supremacy" in breaking current encryption
- Industry preparations and mitigation strategies


Create a report that:

- Synthesizes information from multiple authoritative sources
- Analyzes potential implications for different sectors
- Provides actionable recommendations for organizations
- Save the final report as output/quantum_security_report.md with proper citations and references.

Be concise in all parts of the process. Stop working after you have produced the research report.
