    "Resources are read-only data that an MCP server can expose to the LLM application. Resources are similar to GET endpoints in a REST API - they provide data but shouldn't perform significant computation or have side effects. For example, the resource can be a list of folders within a directory or the content of a file within a folder. Here, the MCP server provides two resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- list of available topic folders under the papers directory;\n",
    "- the papers' information stored under a topic folder.\n"

    "Here's a code snippet that shows how resources are defined in the MCP server again using FastMCP (with the use of the decorator @mcp.resource(uri)). You can find the complete code in the mcp_project folder. The URI defined inside @mcp.resource() is used to uniquely identify the resource and, as a server developer, you can customize the URI. But in general, it follows this scheme: sth://xyz/xcv . In this example, two types of URI were used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- static URI: papers://folders (which represents the list of available topics)\n",
    "- dynamic URI: papers://{topic} (which represents the papers' information under the topic specified by the client during runtime)"
