# Side-by-Side Comparison
# Let's compare our MCP implementation to a traditional function-calling approach in function-calling.py

# At this small scale, the traditional approach is simpler. The key differences become apparent when:

# Scale increases: With dozens of tools, the MCP approach provides better organization
# Reuse matters: The MCP server can be used by multiple clients and applications
# Distribution is needed: MCP provides standard mechanisms for remote operation

# When to Use MCP vs. Traditional Approaches
# Consider MCP when:

# You need to share tool implementations across multiple applications
# You're building a distributed system with components on different machines
# You want to leverage existing MCP servers from the ecosystem
# You're building a product where standardization provides user benefits
